## Overview

We examine the Major League Baseball team data from 2012 to 2018 focusing on a team's batting average (AVG), defensive efficiency ratio (DER), and earned run average (ERA) to predict the number of games a team would win out of 162 in a season. We estimate an Bayesian hierarchical model which explains their attributes based on their functionality.
