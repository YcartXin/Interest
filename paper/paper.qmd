# Introduction

Behind the entertaining personalities and eye-catching traditions of baseball is a game where teams and are meticulously crafted with calculation. Baseball's fascination with numbers persisted since its creation (Swhwarz, 2004). Runs scored have always been recorded to evaluate performance, while other statistics developed overtime into the complicated net of data that now reside upon the MLB official site (). However, a team's performance can differ greatly year to year. A team's last year wins are not often indicative of the coming season. Many factors play into the seasonal performance of a team including more unpredictable variables such as injuries, and luck. However, with the common narrative of baseball being a numbers game, we aim to estimate the impact of important statistics of a team on its games won per season, more specifically, the progressing 2024 season.

You can and should cross-reference sections and sub-sections. We use @citeR and @rohan.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. @sec-data....
We examine the Major League Baseball team data from 2012 to 2018 focusing on a team's batting average (AVG), defensive efficiency ratio (DER), and earned run average (ERA) to predict the number of games a team would win out of 162 in a season. We estimate an Bayesian hierarchical model which explains their attributes based on their functionality.



# Data {#sec-data}


Talk more about it.

And also planes. (You can change the height and width, but don't worry about doing that until you have finished every other aspect of the paper - Quarto will try to make it look nice and the defaults usually work well once you have enough text.)



# Model

The goal of our modelling strategy is twofold. Firstly,...

Here we briefly describe the Bayesian analysis model used to investigate... Background details and diagnostics are included in [Appendix ].

## Model set-up

Define $y_i$ as the number of seconds that the plane remained aloft. Then $\beta_i$ is the wing width and $\gamma_i$ is the wing length, both measured in millimeters.  

\begin{align} 
y_i|\mu_i, \sigma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \beta_i + \gamma_i\\
\alpha &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\gamma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\sigma &\sim \mbox{Exponential}(1)
\end{align}



### Model justification

We expect a positive relationship between the size of the wings and time spent aloft. In particular...

We can use maths by including latex between dollar signs, for instance $\theta$.

# Discussion

## First discussion point {#sec-first-point}

If my paper were 10 pages, then should be be at least 2.5 pages. The discussion is a chance to show off what you know and what you learnt from all this.
